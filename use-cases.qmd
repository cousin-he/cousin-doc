## Accession Numbers

In a public or institutional repository, an **accession number** is a distinct, reliable identifier linked to a genetic resource, biological specimen, or data entry. 

Plant varieties, seed samples, and genetic materials are frequently cataloged in gene banks and databases using accession numbers in agricultural research. Even though other metadata (like name or classification) may change over time, **accession numbers guarantee consistent tracking, referencing, and retrieval**.

In the **COUSIN project**, accession numbers are essential for connecting environmental, genotypic, and phenotypic data. This allows for:

- long-term reproducibility  
- data consistency  
- and interoperability across datasets.
