## Introduction to Pipelines

A data pipeline is a systematic sequence of processes designed to automate the extraction, transformation, and movement of data from various sources to a destination such as a database, data warehouse, or analytics tool. By efficiently orchestrating data collection, processing, and storage, data pipelines ensure that information flows reliably and is ready for analysis, reporting, or integration with other systems. Well-designed pipelines are essential for organizations aiming to leverage data-driven insights, maintain data quality, and support business intelligence initiatives
## Pipelines and agronomy
Data pipelines play a crucial role in modern agronomy by enabling the efficient collection, processing, and management of data from field experiments and agricultural activities. These pipelines integrate data from diverse sources—such as soil sensors, weather stations, and operational records—to support real-time decision-making and long-term planning. In the context of agronomy, robust data pipelines help scientists and farmers monitor crop conditions, optimize resource use, and maintain the integrity and safety of both digital and physical infrastructure, including pipelines that may be located near agricultural land. This integration of technology and agriculture drives innovation, enhances productivity, and supports sustainable practices.
