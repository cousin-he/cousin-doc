## Creating this website

This site has been generated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a software tool for
scientific technical documentation suitable for different programming languages. 
To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

COUSIN has also created a practical [Quarto workshop](https://cousin-he.github.io/quarto-workshop/),
introducing its applications for scientific documentation and publishing.
