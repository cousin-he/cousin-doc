## MCPD
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and Bioversity International (formerly IPGRI) collaborated to create the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (MCPD), an internationally accepted data standard, to make it easier to consistently document and share passport information for plant genetic resources (PGR) across a variety of crops and collections. A core set of descriptors, including accession identifier, taxon, geographical origin, holding institute, and biological status, are specified by the MCPD standard to facilitate the consistent description and international exchange of germplasm data. Through the provision of precise definitions, coding schemes, and recommended field names, MCPD facilitates data integration and interoperability with other systems and standards, including crop-specific descriptor lists and the FAO World Information and Early Warning System (WIEWS). Because of its adaptable structure, networks or user groups can expand  the descriptor list for specific needs, as long as compatibility with the standard format is maintained. With its widespread adoption by genebanks and research organisations across the globe, MCPD is a fundamental standard for the exchange, discoverability, and management of data pertaining to plant genetic resources.

## ISA
In the fields of life science, environmental, and biomedical research, the open-source, community-driven ISA (Investigation/Study/Assay) metadata tracking framework was created to make it easier to collect, curate, manage, publish, and reuse experimental data in a standards-compliant manner. Three primary components form the foundation of the ISA model: the study (the unit of research), the assay (an analytical measurement), and the investigation (the project context). This hierarchical structure ensures transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability by enabling a detailed description of experimental metadata, including sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, and sample-to-data relationships. The ISA software suite is an essential tool for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management in scientific research because it supports multiple serialisation formats (including ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON) and integrates with a wide range of public repositories and analysis tools.

## BrAPI
The open-source, standardised BrAPI (Breeding API) RESTful web service API specification was created to make it easier for various tools, databases, and applications to integrate and exchange plant breeding data. BrAPI supports interoperability throughout the entire life cycle of breeding data, including project management, sample and germplasm management, and the collection and analysis of phenotypic and genotypic data, by establishing a common set of data models and API endpoints. Its adaptability and modularity facilitate compatibility with other data standards like MIAPPE, MCPD, and ICASA and make it simple to implement in a range of programming languages. A worldwide community of software developers, data managers, and plant breeders creates and maintains BrAPI, which is extensively used in both industry and research to streamline data sharing, improve collaboration, and accelerate innovation in plant breeding.
## MIAPPE
An open, community-driven data standard called MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) was created to standardise and make it easier for researchers studying plant phenotyping to share, publish, and reuse experimental and computed data. The standard offers a thorough checklist and data model for metadata, guaranteeing that all pertinent details are consistently and clearly recorded, including biological material, experimental design, observed variables, and environmental conditions. The most recent version of MIAPPE (1.1) guarantees compatibility with popular frameworks such as ISA-Tools and the Breeding API (BrAPI), expands its scope to include woody plants, and specifies a formal data model for better implementation and validation. MIAPPE facilitates interoperability, automated validation, and improved data reusability across various plant phenotyping experiments and platforms by endorsing community-relevant vocabularies and upholding the FAIR data principles.
